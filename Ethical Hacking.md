# 🔐 Information Security Concepts

Information Security (InfoSec) is the practice of protecting information and information systems against:

- Unauthorized access
- Disclosure
- Modification
- Destruction
- Disruption

The primary goal is to ensure that information remains secure while allowing authorized users to access it whenever needed.

> **Information is one of the most valuable assets of any organization.**

Loss of information may result in:

- Financial loss
- Business disruption
- Legal penalties
- Loss of customer trust
- Reputation damage

---

# 🛡️ Elements of Information Security

Information Security is built upon **five major pillars**.

---

## 1. Confidentiality

Ensures that information is accessible **only to authorized individuals**.

### Examples

- Medical records
- Bank information
- Passwords
- Company secrets

### Threats

- Data theft
- Unauthorized access
- Insider attacks

### Security Controls

- Encryption
- Access Control
- Data Classification
- Secure Media Disposal

---

## 2. Integrity

Integrity ensures that information remains **accurate, complete, and unaltered**.

### Threats

- Data modification
- SQL Injection
- Malware

### Security Controls

- Hashing
- Checksums
- File Integrity Monitoring
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

---

## 3. Availability

Ensures systems and information remain available whenever authorized users need them.

### Threats

- DDoS attacks
- Hardware failures
- Ransomware

### Security Controls

- Backups
- RAID
- Clustering
- Load Balancing
- Disaster Recovery
- Antivirus

---

## 4. Authenticity

Ensures that users, devices, and data are genuine.

### Security Controls

- Digital Certificates
- Biometrics
- Smart Cards
- Multi-Factor Authentication

---

## 5. Non-Repudiation

Ensures that neither sender nor receiver can deny an action.

### Example

A digitally signed email proves:

- Sender actually sent it
- Receiver actually received it

### Security Controls

- Digital Signatures
- PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)

---
